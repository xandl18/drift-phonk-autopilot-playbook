- Add descriptive comments
- Validate against schema

### Documentation
- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples where helpful
- Keep safety warnings prominent
- Update README if needed

## 🧪 Testing

Before submitting:

1. **Run existing tests**: `python -m pytest tests/`
2. **Test your changes**: Create tests for new functionality
3. **Simulation testing**: Test all patterns in simulation mode
4. **Safety validation**: Verify all safety features work

## 📦 Pull Request Process

1. **Create a descriptive title**: Clearly describe what your PR does
2. **Provide details**: Explain the changes and why they're needed
3. **Link issues**: Reference any related issues
4. **Include tests**: Add or update tests as needed
5. **Update documentation**: Update docs if your changes affect usage
6. **Safety review**: Highlight any safety-related changes

## 🎵 Pattern Contribution Guidelines

When contributing new drift patterns:

### Required Fields
```yaml
name: "Pattern Name"
description: "Clear description"
version: "1.0"
music_file: "relative/path/to/music.mp3"
difficulty: "beginner|intermediate|advanced"
max_speed: 25  # Safety limit
steps: [...]   # Pattern steps
```

### Best Practices
- Start with lower speeds for safety
- Include smooth transitions
- Add descriptive step names
- Test thoroughly in simulation
- Consider different skill levels
